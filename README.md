# 5-Random-User-Generator-API

In this project I connect to RandomUser Generator API and using for fetching data. This is an API that generqates dummy data.

This application is going to be dynamic where I can select the number of users that I want to return. 

I have added one function to the application after clicking on the user, it just puts at the top of the page.


Unpretentious style included!
